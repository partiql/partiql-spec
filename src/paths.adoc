== Path Navigation

[discrete]
==== Tuple path navigation

A _tuple path navigation_ stem:[t.a] from the tuple stem:[t] to its
attribute stem:[a] (<<#figure:query:bnf>> line 27) returns the value
of the attribute stem:[a]. (We discuss below the corner case where a
tuple has multiple attributes `a`.) stem:[t] is an expression but
stem:[a] is always an identifier (<<#figure:names:bnf>> lines
5-6). For example:

[subs="+normal"]
[%unbreakable]
====
[source, partiql]
----
{'a': 1, 'b':2}.a
----
stem:[<=>]
[source, partiql]
----
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}."a"
----
stem:[->]
[source,partiql]
----
1
----
====

Even if there were a variable `a`, bound to `'b'`, the result of the
above expression would still be `1`, because the identifier `a` (or
`"a"`) is interpreted as the "`look for the attribute named `a` `"
when it follows the dot in a tuple path navigation. The semantics of
tuple path navigation do not depend on whether the tuple is ordered or
unordered by schema.

[discrete]
==== Array navigation

An _array navigation_ stem:[a\[i\]] returns the stem:[i]-th element
_when_ it is applied on an array stem:[a] (<<#figure:query:bnf>> line
28) and stem:[i] is an expression that evaluates into an integer. Both
stem:[a] and stem:[i] are expressions. For example:

[subs="+normal"]
[%unbreakable]
====
[source, partiql]
----
[2, 4, 6][1+1]
----
stem:[->]
[source,partiql]
----
6
----
====

[discrete]
==== Tuple navigation with array notation

The expression stem:[a\[s\]] is a shorthand for the tuple path
navigation stem:[a.s] when the expression stem:[s] is either (a) a
string literal or (b) an expression that is explicitly `CAST` into a
string. For example:

[subs="+normal"]
[%unbreakable]
====
[source, partiql]
----
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}['a']
----
stem:[<=>]
[source, partiql]
----
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}.'a'
----
stem:[->]
[source,partiql]
----
1
----
====

Similarly:

[subs="+normal"]
====
[source, partiql]
----
{'attr': 1, 'b':2}[CAST('at' || 'tr' AS STRING)]
----
stem:[->]
[source,partiql]
----
1
----
====


If stem:[s] is not a string literal or an expression that is cast into
a string, then stem:[a\[s\]] is evaluated as an array path
navigation. Notice that in the absence of an explicit cast, the
navigation stem:[a\[e\]] evaluates as an array navigation, even if
stem:[e] ends up evaluating to a string. For example, let us assume
that the variable `v` is bound to `at` and the variable `w` is bound
to `tr`.  Still, the expression:

// TODO determine if cases where static type is known requires a CAST.

[source, partiql]
----
{'attr': 1, 'b':2}[v || w]
----

does not evaluate to `1`. It is treated as an array navigation with wrongly
typed index and it will return `MISSING`, for reasons explained below.

[discrete]
==== Composition of navigations

Notice that consecutive tuple/array navigations (e.g. `r.no[1]`)
navigate deeply into complex values. Notice further that paths
consisting of plain tuple and array path navigations evaluate to a
unique value.

// TODO verify that this is correct for unordered tuples.

[discrete]
==== Tuple navigation in tuples with duplicate attributes

When the tuple `t` has multiple attributes `a`, the tuple path navigation `t.a` will
return the first instance of `a`. Note that for tuples whose order is
defined by schema, this is well-defined, for unordered tuples, it is
implementation defined which attribute is returned in _permissive mode_
or an error in _type checking mode_, which is described in
<<sec:tuple-path-on-wrong>>.

If one wants to access all instances of `a`, she should use the
`UNPIVOT` feature instead (see <<sec:unpivot>>). For example, the
following query returns the list of all `a` values in a tuple `t`.

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
SELECT VALUE v
FROM UNPIVOT t AS v AT attr
WHERE attr = 'a'
----

[[sec:tuple-path-on-wrong]]
=== Tuple path evaluation on wrongly typed data

In the case of tuple paths, since PartiQL does not assume a schema, the
semantics must also specify the return value when:

1. stem:[t] is not a tuple (i.e., when the expression stem:[t] does
not evaluate into a tuple), or

2. stem:[t] is a tuple that does not have an stem:[a] attribute.

[discrete]
==== Permissive mode

PartiQL can operate in a permissive mode or in a conventional type
checking mode, where the query fails once typing errors (such as the
above mentioned ones) happen. In the permissive mode, typing errors are
typically neglected by using the semantics outlined next.

In all of the above cases PartiQL returns the special value
`MISSING`. Recall, the `MISSING` is different from `NULL`. The
distinction enables PartiQL to be able to distinguish between a tuple
(JSON object) that lacked an attribute `a` and a tuple (JSON object)
whose `a` attribute was `NULL`. This distinction, coupled with
appropriate features on how result tuples are constructed (see
`SELECT` clause in <<sec:select-values>>), enables PartiQL to easily
preserve (when needed) the distinction between absent attribute and
null-valued attribute.

For example, the expression ` 'not a tuple'.a ` and the expression
`{'a':1, 'b':2}` evaluate to `MISSING`.

The above semantics apply regardless of whether the tuple navigation
is accomplished via the dot notation or via the array notation. For
example, the expression `{'a':1, 'b':2}['noSuchAttribute']` will also
evaluate to `MISSING`.

[discrete]
==== Type checking mode

In the type checking mode and in the absence of schema, PartiQL will
fail when tuple path navigation is applied on wrongly typed data.

[[sec:schema-in-tuple-path]]
==== Role of schema in type checking

In the presence of schema, PartiQL may return a compile-time error when
the query processor can prove that the path expression is guaranteed to
_always_ produce `MISSING`. The extent of error detection is
implementation-specific.

For example, in the presence of schema validation, an PartiQL query
processor can throw a compile-time error when given the path expression
`{a:1, b:2}.c`. In a more important and common case, an PartiQL implementation can
utilize the input data schema to prove that a path expression _always_
returns `MISSING` and thus throw a compile-time error. For example, assume that `sometable` is
an SQL table whose schema does not include an attribute `c`. Then, an
PartiQL implementation may throw a compile-time error when evaluating
the query:

[source, partiql]
----
SELECT t.a, t.c FROM sometable AS t
----

Apparently, such an PartiQL implementation is fully compatible with the
behavior of an SQL processor. Generally, if a rigid schema is explicitly
present, a tuple path navigation error can be caught during compilation
time; this is the case in SQL itself, where referring to a non-existent
attribute leads to a compilation error for the query.

Notice that operating with schema validation may not prevent all tuple
path navigations from being applied to wrongly typed data. The choice
between permissive mode versus type checking mode dictates what happens
next in these cases: If permissive, the tuple path navigation evaluates
into `MISSING`. If in type checking mode, the query fails.

[[sec:array-on-wrong]]
=== Array navigation evaluation on wrongly typed data

In the permissive mode, an array navigation evaluation
stem:[a\[i\]] will result into `MISSING` in each of the following cases:

* stem:[a] does not evaluate into an array, or
* stem:[i] does not evaluate into a positive integer within the
arrayâ€™s bounds.

For example, `[1,2,3][1.0]` evaluates to `MISSING` since `1.0` is not
an integer - even though it is coercible to an integer.

In type checking mode, the query will fail in each one of the cases
above.

[[sec:deep-navigation]]
=== Additional Path Syntax

The following additional path functionalities are explained by reduction
to the basic tuple navigation and array navigation.

[discrete]
==== Wildcard steps

The expression stem:[e\[**\]] reduces to (i.e., is equivalent to):

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
SELECT VALUE v FROM e AS v
----

where stem:[v] is a _fresh variable_, i.e., a variable that does not
already appear in the query. Similarly, when the expression stem:[e.**]
is not a `SELECT` clause item of the form stem:[t.*], where stem:[t] is a
variable, it reduces to:

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
SELECT VALUE v FROM UNPIVOT e AS v
----

where stem:[v] is a fresh variable. An expression stem:[t.**], where
stem:[t] is a variable and the expression appears as a `SELECT` clause
item, is interpreted according to the `SELECT` clause semantics
(<<sec:sql-star>>).

The expression:

----
[1,2,3][*]
----

[source, partiql]
----
SELECT VALUE v FROM [1, 2, 3] AS v
----
stem:[->]
[source, partiql]
----

----

The expression:

[source, partiql]
----
{'a':1, 'b':2}.*
----
stem:[<=>]
[source, partiql]
----
SELECT VALUE v FROM UNPIVOT {'a':1, 'b':2} AS v
----
stem:[->]
[source, partiql]
----
<<1,2>>
----

Whereas the following query:

[source, partiql]
----
SELECT t.* FROM <<{'a':1, 'b':1}, {'a':2, 'b':2}>> AS t
----
stem:[->]
[source, partiql]
----
<< {'a':1, 'b':1}, {'a':2, 'b':2} >>
----

does not do the transformation with `UNPIVOT`. If one does not want
this behavior, `SELECT VALUE` can be used (<<sec:select-values>>).

[discrete]
==== Path Expressions with Wildcards

PartiQL also provides multi-step path expressions, called _path
collection expressions_. Their semantics is a generalization of the
semantics of a path expression with a single stem:[\[**\]] or
stem:[.**]. Consider the path collection expression:

[stem]
++++
e w_1 p_1...w_n p_n
++++

where stem:[e] is any expression; stem:[n>0]; each _wildcard step_
stem:[w_i] is either stem:[\[**\]] or stem:[.**]; each _series of
plain path steps_ stem:[p_i] is a sequence of zero or more tuple path
navigations or array navigations (potentially mixed).

Then the path collection expression is equivalent to the SFW query


[source%unbreakable, partiql, subs="+normal"]
----
SELECT VALUE vn.pn
FROM
    u1 e AS v1,
    u2 v1.p1 AS v1,
    . . .
    un @vn-1.pn-1 AS vn
----

where each stem:[v_i] is a fresh variable and each stem:[u_i] is
`UNPIVOT` if stem:[w_i] is a stem:[.**] and it is nothing if
stem:[w_i] is a stem:[\[**\]]. Intuitively stem:[v_i] corresponds to
the stem:[i]-th star.

According to the above, consider the following query:

[source, partiql]
----
SELECT VALUE foo FROM e.* AS foo
----

reduces to

[source, partiql]
----
SELECT VALUE foo FROM (SELECT VALUE v FROM UNPIVOT e AS v) AS foo
----

which is equivalent to

[source, partiql]
----
SELECT VALUE foo FROM UNPIVOT e AS foo
----

Next, consider the path collection expression:

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
tables.items[*].product.*.nest
----

This expression reduces to

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
SELECT
  VALUE v2.nest
FROM
  tables.items AS v1,
  UNPIVOT @v1.product AS v2
