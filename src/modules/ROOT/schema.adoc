== Structural Types and Type-related Query Syntax and Semantics (WIP)

The input data generally conform to a _structural type_, also often
called _schema_. The SQL semantics make extensive use of the structural
types in order to assign meaning to queries, which would not have a
meaning in the absence of such structural types.

In the interest of SQL compatibility and user convenience, PartiQL also
allows structural types to assign meaning to queries that would not have
a meaning otherwise.

We will soon specify the precise rules that provide SQL compatibility,
while keeping the schema optional and the query results stable with
respect to schema addition.
