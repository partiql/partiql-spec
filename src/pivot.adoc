== `PIVOT` Clause Semantics

The `PIVOT` clause inputs a bag of binding tuples or an array of
binding tuples.  Semantically, it is similar to `SELECT VALUE` but
whereas the latter creates a collection of values, `PIVOT` constructs
a tuple where the each input binding is evaluated to an attribute
value pair in the tuple.

The clause:


[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
PIVOT v AT a
----

inputs a bag or an array of binding tuples and outputs a single tuple
where each evaluation of stem:[v] and stem:[a] generate an attribute
in the tuple.

This example illustrates a `PIVOT` that creates a tuple from a
collection of tuples.

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
PIVOT x.v AT x.a
FROM << {'a': 'first', 'v': 'john'}, {'a': 'last', 'v': 'doe'} as x >>
----

The result is

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
{'first':'john', 'last':'doe'}
----

The expression stem:[a] is expected to evaluate into a string
value. In strict mode, it is an error if this evaluates to a
non-string value. In permissive mode, the attribute is considered
`MISSING` and does not appear in the output. The expression stem:[v]
can be any PartiQL value, but if it is `MISSING` it will not be
generated in the resulting tuple.
