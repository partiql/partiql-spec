== Coercion of subqueries

In PartiQL, as is the case with SQL as well, expressions may involve
SFW subqueries (<<#figure:query:bnf>> line 17). PartiQL SFW subqueries
are enclosed in parentheses (i.e., identical to SQL). For
compatibility with SQL, a SFW subquery starting with a `SELECT` clause
(as opposed to a subquery starting with `SELECT VALUE` or `PIVOT`)
coerces into a scalar or into an array, depending on the context. The
following cases replicate SQLâ€™s coercing behavior and analyze in which
cases the result of a subquery coerces into scalar and in which cases
they coerce into arrays.

An PartiQL extension with respect to SQL is that, in the permissive
mode, subqueries that fail to coerce to the required type (scalar or
tuple) still run, as opposed to failing. They simply omit from the
results the data that correspond to the coercion failures.

[[sec:select-coercion-scalar]]
=== Coercion of a `SELECT` subquery into a scalar

In each of the following cases a SFW subquery coerces into a scalar

* if it appears as the rhs of a comparison operator (`=`, `>`, etc)
where the lhs is not an array literal. And, vice versa, if it appears
as the lhs of a comparison operator where the rhs is not an array
literal. (If it is the lhs of a comparison operator where the lhs is
an array literal, it coerces into array, per
<<sec:select-coercion-array>>.)

* if it is an SFW subquery expression that (a) is not the collection
expression of a `FROM` clause item and (b) is not the rhs of an
`IN`. (If it is the rhs of an `IN` then it should not be coerced.)

Essentially, a subquery that is coerced may appear in all clauses
except the `FROM`. For example, it may be a `SELECT` subquery stem:[s]
that appears as an item of a `SELECT`, `SELECT VALUE`, or `PIVOT`
clause. Or it may be a subexpression of an expression that appears in
`SELECT`, `SELECT VALUE` , or `PIVOT` clause. Or it may be a
subexpression of the `WHERE` clause expression, as long as it is not
the rhs of an `IN`. In any of these cases the result of the subquery
stem:[s] is cast into a scalar.

Technically, the subquery stem:[s] (which uses `SELECT`) is rewritten
into an equivalent subquery stem:[s'] that utilizes `SELECT VALUE`, by
following the steps of <<sec:sql-select>>. Then the result of
stem:[s'] is cast into a scalar by applying the function
stem:["COLL_TO_SCALAR"(s')].

SELECT VALUE {
    'foo':  v.foo
    'bar':  COLL_TO_SCALAR(SELECT VALUE {'bar':  w.bar}
                           FROM someDataSet w
                           WHERE w.sth = v.sthelse)
}
FROM anotherDataSet v

As is the common semantics of PartiQL in the permissive mode, when
`COLL_TO_SCALAR` fails to cast the subquery into a scalar, it outputs
`MISSING`. The inputs that are coerced into scalars are the ones that
SQL prescribes: When the input is a collection consisting of a single
tuple with a single attribute, the input is coerced into a scalar. All
other inputs to `COLL_TO_SCALAR` lead to `MISSING`.


// .{nbsp} generates a `Figure X.` caption with no 'label'
.{nbsp} 
[#xmpl:coercion-failure%unbreakable]

====
In this example, in one instance the inner `SELECT` evaluates to a
collection with more than one element. Because the `COLL_TO_SCALAR`
function produces a `MISSING` instead of failing, the query works.

Consider the tables

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
customers :  [
    {'id':1, 'name':'Mary'},
    {'id':2, 'name':'Helen'},
    {'id':1, 'name':'John'}
]
orders :  [
    {'custId':1, 'name':'foo'},
    {'custId':2, 'name':'bar'}
]
----

The following query would fail in SQL, because there are two customer
tuples with the same id. Of course, in a well-designed SQL database that
has a primary key or uniqueness constraint on the id, there would not be
two customers with the same id. However, lack of constraints is typical
in the data targeted by PartiQL. This query runs in the permissive mode
of PartiQL.

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
SELECT o.name AS orderName,
       (SELECT c.name FROM customers c WHERE c.id=o.custId) AS customerName
FROM orders o
----

The result is


[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
<< {'orderName':'foo'}, {'orderName':'bar', 'customerName':'Helen'} >>
----

Notice the missing `'customerName'` in the first tuple.
====

As in SQL, an implementation with static type checks will be able to
detect and warn that, in certain cases, a coercion will always fail and
produce `MISSING`.

The following `SELECT` clause is guaranteed to produce tuples with
`bar` and `bar2`. Thus it cannot coerce into scalar.

[source%unbreakable, partiql]
----
SELECT w.bar1 AS bar1, w.bar2 AS bar2
FROM someDataSet w
----  

Static type analysis can infer that the nested query above will
deliver tuples consisting of `bar` and `bar2`. Thus, even before
accessing any data, it can warn the user that this query is erroneous.

[[sec:select-coercion-array]]
=== Coercion of a `SELECT` subquery into an array

An `SELECT` SFW subquery coerces into an array when it is the rhs
(respectively, lhs) of a comparison operator whose other argument is
an array. footnote:[Recall, in the interest of compatibility to SQL, PartiQL
allows array literals to be denoted with parentheses instead of
brackets (see <<sec:array-constructor>>).]

The reduction of a `SELECT` subquery to the PartiQL is exhibited by the following
example.
