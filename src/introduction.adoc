This document is currently a working draft and subject to change.
Certain sections are marked as "`work in progress`" (WIP) and will be
expanded soon.

=== Audience

This document presents the formal syntax and semantics of PartiQL. It is
oriented to PartiQL query processor builders who need the full and
formal detail on PartiQL.

SQL users who are not interested in the full detail and the complete
formalism but are interested in learning how PartiQL extends SQL may
also read the tutorial. Unlike this formal specification, the tutorial
has a "`how to`" orientation and is primarily driven by examples.

=== PartiQL core and PartiQL syntactic sugar

In the interest of precision and succinctness, we tier the PartiQL
specification in two layers: The PartiQL core is a functional
programming language with composable aspects. Three aspects of the
PartiQL core syntax and semantics are characteristic of its functional
orientation: Every (sub)query and every (sub) expression input and
output PartiQL data. Second, each clause of a SELECT query is itself a
function. Third, every (sub)query evaluates within the environment
created by the database names and the variables of the enclosing
queries.

Then we layer "`syntactic sugar`" features over the core. Commonly,
syntactic sugar achieves well-known SQL syntax and semantics. Formally,
every syntactic sugar feature is explained by reduction to the core.
