== `WHERE` clause

The `WHERE` clause inputs the bindings that have been produced from
the `FROM` clause and outputs the ones that satisfy its condition.

The boolean predicates follow SQLâ€™s 3-valued logic. Recall, PartiQL
has two kinds of absent values: `NULL` and `MISSING`. As far as the
boolean connectives and `IS NULL` are concerned a `NULL` input and a
`MISSING` input behave identically. For example, `MISSING AND TRUE` is
equivalent to `NULL AND TRUE`: they both result into `NULL`.

For the semantics of equality and of other functions, see
<<sec:preds-and-fns>>.

Alike SQL, when the expression of the `WHERE` clause expression
evaluates to an absent value or a value that is not a Boolean, PartiQL
eliminates the corresponding binding.

The predicate `IS MISSING` allows distinguishing between `NULL` and
`MISSING`: `NULL IS MISSING` results to false; `MISSING IS MISSING`
results to true.
