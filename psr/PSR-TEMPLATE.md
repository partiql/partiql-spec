# PartiQL Specification Request

- Feature Name: (fill me in with a unique name, i.e. `my-awesome-feature`)
- Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
- PartiQL Implementation Issue(s): 
    - (fill me in with any known links to issues for the implemention of this PSR)

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the language and you were teaching it to a PartiQL end-user. 
That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how PartiQL query authors and service owners should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact 
the way they use PartiQL. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample queries that utilize the new feature, including source data and expected results.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the PSR. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- It is clear that it does not break compliance with the SQL_-92 specification, or if it does, articulate why it is 
necessary to do so.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed 
proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?  What possible downsides does this proposal have?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- What is the impact of not doing this?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what this can include 
are:

- Is this part of the SQL-92 specification or an extension of it?
- Does this feature exist in other SQL impelementations?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to 
refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other SQL implementations, 
provide readers of your PSR with a fuller picture.  If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are 
interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

Note that while precedent set by other SQL implementations is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate a PSR.
Please also take into consideration that PartiQL sometimes intentionally diverges from common language features.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the PSR process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this PSR that could be addressed in the future independently 
of the solution that comes out of this PSR?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the language 
and project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible 
interactions with the project and language in your proposal.  Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for 
the project and of the relevant sub-team.  

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the PSR you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.
